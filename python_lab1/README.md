# Lab 1: Python Syntax and Data Types

## Overview
This lab introduces fundamental Python programming concepts including variables, data types, user input, type conversion, and basic operations.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and implement Python's basic syntax rules
- Define and work with Python's fundamental data types (int, float, str, bool)
- Use the type() function to identify variable data types
- Utilize the input() function to collect user input
- Perform basic arithmetic and string operations
- Apply type conversion functions to change data types
